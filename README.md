## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to use different selectors like the `nextElementSibling` selector or the `children[i]` selector:

```JavaScript
questionEl.nextElementSibling.classList.toggle('hidden');
questionEl.children[2].classList.toggle('hidden');
questionEl.children[1].classList.toggle('hidden');
```

### Continued development

I will continue to learn the basics of JavaScript and DOM manipulation
